# RRT
RRT Algorithm

Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) implementations in python from psuedocode.

A vanila version (RRT_v1) with goal biasing, another version (RRT_v2) with the extend() function encompassinging the steps of nearest node finding, steering, obstacle checking, and goal checking.

With the extend() function, performing a bi-directional tree search is convenient (BiDirectionalRRT). This last version also has a final path optimisation in the form of linear interpolation to improve final path.
